# Milestone Project 1
***

## _One Last Rep Responsive Website Project_
***

### What does it do and what does it need to fulfil?
This Milestone project creation is the culmination of learning and study from the first three modules of the Full Stack Developer
Course, HTML, CSS & User Centric Frontend Development, to build a mobile-first fully responsive website for a local startup Gym,
"One Last Rep."

This website creates a centered point for non-members and members alike to view the facilities and amenities at play,
the classes available, the wide facet of coaching and contact the Gym directly through a contact form.

### Functionality of Project.

The project utilises the Bootstrap Framework to create a multi-page fully responsive, Mobile-First approach Website. It is completely
within the scope of the guidelines of the milestone requirements and does not populate any back-end functions, nor
has any custom javascript been used. With that in mind please note that although this website contains two "forms", one fulfilling a
contact form requirement and one fulfilling a booking system for a Free class, they do not alert anyone that a submission has been
created and will not populate any server database.

Both forms hold data validation and all fields residing within are set to <i>required</i> ensuring information submitted is of 
the correct format. As is customary, both forms notify the user that their personal information such as, Name/Email/Phone etc will not be
shared with anyone, ensuring a sense of General Data Protection Regulations.

The font used throughout the site was imported into the HTML of each page from Google Fonts and is called <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=oswald">'Oswald'</a>, 
bringing a consistency to accompany the Corporate Branding and color scheme of the Company, throughout the website.

As described above, this project went outside the original brief and is based on the needs of a real-life local company and will be used to 
fulfill a considerable gap in their entry stake into the marketplace. Given this, the functionality of the website will evolve over time to incorporate 
a Merchandise store, interactive Video Tours, and Online bookings & payments


### Technologies Used.
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap Framework
* PyCharm IDE
* Bash
* Ubuntu
* Git
* Github
* TinyJPG.com
* Google Chrome Developer Tools
* Eye Dropper (Color Picker) Open Source Google Chrome Extension
* Some Imported Javascript & JQuery for the Modal

### Deployment.

Website was created in PyCharm IDE. PyCharm is an Integrated Development Environment developed by JetBrains. I choose PyCharm
as my chosen IDE due to the enhanced programming capabilities therein and for further exposure to a non-browser related IDE.
Through PyCharm a local Git Repository was used, as was Github to ensure Version Controlling of the website was present from
the inception through to finalisation and deployment. <i>Deployment details go here.......</i>


### Testing.

<i>Talk about testing of each facet of each website and on what devices....talk about Chrome Dev Tools....
Talk about hyperlinks testing & modal/CTAs etc. Talk about using Slack and other CI students to test the overall product.
Talk about overriding user agent stylings inherited on some elements like, UL & strange padding, found during testing. </i>


### Work based on other code.

<i>Consider using modal from Whiskey drop page and fragment it to suit our requirements and detail here.....</i>


### What changed after UXD (user design experience) phase.
   Originally planned to have the timetable viewable as one of the webpages....however, after some consideration
   decided to have it as a clickable hyperlink to open in a new window to be viewed, saved or downloaded.
