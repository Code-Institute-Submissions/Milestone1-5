One Last Rep Responsive Website Project {Milestone Project 1}

What does it do and what does it need to fulfil?
   This project uses skills learned from the first 3 modules of the Full Stack Developer Course, (HTML, CSS, &
   User Centric Frontend Development), to build a mobile-first responsive website for a local Gym, One Last Rep.

   This website creates a centered point for non-members and members alike to view the facilities and amenities at play,
   the classes available, the wide facet of coaching and contact the Gym directly through a contact form.

What changed after UXD (user design experience) phase.
   Originally planned to have the timetable viewable as one of the webpages....however, after some consideration
   decided to have it as a clickable hyperlink to open in a new window to be viewed, saved or downloaded.
