##_One Last Rep Responsive Website Project {Milestone Project 1}_
***

### What does it do and what does it need to fulfil?
   This project uses skills learned from the first 3 modules of the Full Stack Developer Course, (HTML, CSS, &
   User Centric Frontend Development), to build a mobile-first responsive website for a local Gym, "One Last Rep".

   This website creates a centered point for non-members and members alike to view the facilities and amenities at play,
   the classes available, the wide facet of coaching and contact the Gym directly through a contact form.

### Functionality of Project.

<i>Detail full functionality of the website here....mobile first response rates and elements shown etc etc.</i>


### Technologies Used.
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap Framework
* Bash
* Ubuntu
* Git
* Github
* PyCharm IDE
* Google Chrome Developer Tools
* Some Imported Javascript & JQuery for the Modal

### Deployment.

Website was created in PyCharm IDE. PyCharm is an Integrated Development Environment developed by JetBrains. I choose PyCharm
as my chosen IDE due to the enhanced programming capabilities therein and for further exposure to a non-browser related IDE.
Through PyCharm a local Git Repository was used, as was Github to ensure Version Controlling of the website was present from
the inception through to finalisation and deployment. <i>Deployment details go here.......</i>


### Testing.

<i>Talk about testing of each facet of each website and on what devices....talk about Chrome Dev Tools....
Talk about hyperlinks testing & modal/CTAs etc. Talk about using Slack and other CI students to test the overall product.</i>


### Work based on other code.

<i>Consider using modal from Whiskey drop page and fragment it to suit our requirements and detail here.....</i>


### What changed after UXD (user design experience) phase.
   Originally planned to have the timetable viewable as one of the webpages....however, after some consideration
   decided to have it as a clickable hyperlink to open in a new window to be viewed, saved or downloaded.
