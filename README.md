# Milestone Project 1
***

## _One Last Rep Responsive Website Project_
***

### What does it do and what does it need to fulfil?
This Milestone project creation is the culmination of learning and study from the first three modules of the Full Stack Developer
Course, HTML, CSS & User Centric Frontend Development, to build a mobile-first fully responsive website for a local startup Gym,
"One Last Rep."

![alt text](https://github.com/auxfuse/Milestone1/blob/master/images/olrfitnesslogo.png "One Last Rep Logo")

This website creates a centered point for non-members and members alike to view the facilities and amenities at play,
the classes available, the wide facet of coaching and contact the Gym directly through a contact form.

### Functionality of Project.

The project utilises the Bootstrap Framework to create a multi-page fully responsive, Mobile-First approach Website. It is completely
within the scope of the guidelines of the milestone requirements and does not populate any back-end functions, nor
has any custom javascript been used. With that in mind please note that although this website contains two "forms", one fulfilling a
contact form requirement and one fulfilling a booking system for a Free class, they do not alert anyone that a submission has been
created and will not populate any server database.

Both forms hold data validation and all fields residing within are set to <i>required</i> ensuring information submitted is of 
the correct format. As is customary, both forms notify the user that their personal information such as, Name/Email/Phone etc will not be
shared with anyone, ensuring a sense of General Data Protection Regulations.

The font used throughout the site was imported into the HTML of each page from Google Fonts and is called <a href="https://fonts.google.com/?query=oswald">'Oswald'</a>, 
bringing a consistency to accompany the Corporate Branding and color scheme of the Company, throughout the website.

As described above, this project went outside the original brief and is based on the needs of a real-life local company and will be used to 
fulfill a considerable gap in their entry stake into the marketplace. Given this, the functionality of the website will evolve over time to incorporate 
a Merchandise store, interactive Video Tours, and Online bookings & payments


### Technologies Used.
* HTML ~ main Language used to structure the individual pages of the website.
* CSS ~ styling language used to format and visually build upon the accompanying HTML.
* <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/"> Bootstrap Framework</a> ~ Used as the core structuring layout building blocks of the website, ensuring mobile-frist design and responsive size display.
* <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm IDE</a> ~ PyCharm was used as the preferred IDE for this project.
* PyCharm built-in Terminal ~ Used to commit to local repository and further push to Github Repo ensuring version controlling of the project build.
* <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> ~ Installed on local device and integrated to PyCharm as a Plugin to enable version controlling.
* <a href="https://github.com/auxfuse/Milestone1">Github</a> ~ Used to host the deployed website and repository of all previous versions of the build.
* <a href="https://tinyjpg.com/">TinyJPG.com</a> ~ Used to compress images used throughout the website without affecting image quality/integrity.
* Google Chrome Developer Tools ~ Used as the core test phase throughout the project build life, testing the responsiveness of elements and CSS visuals.
* <a href="http://eye-dropper.kepi.cz/">Eye Dropper (Color Picker)</a> ~ Open Source Google Chrome Extension used to obtain hexadecimal/rgba/hsl values of colours. Built by Kepi (<a href="https://github.com/kepi">Kepi's Github</a>)
* Some <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/#js">Imported Javascript & JQuery</a> ~ for the Modal and Responsive Navbar expand & collapse functionality.

### Deployment.

Website was created in PyCharm IDE. PyCharm is an Integrated Development Environment developed by JetBrains. I choose PyCharm
as my chosen IDE due to the enhanced programming capabilities therein and for further exposure to a non-browser related IDE.
Through PyCharm a local Git Repository was used, as was Github to ensure Version Controlling of the website was present from
the inception through to finalisation and deployment.

Cloning & Details:

In order to clone the website:
* Select the Repository from the Github Dashboard.
* Click on the "Clone or download" green button located above and to the right of the File Structure table.
* Click on the "clipboard" icon to the right of the Git URL to copy the web URL of the Clone.
* 
* 
* 
* 

In order to deploy the website to Github pages, I:
* Selected the Repository from the Github Dashboard.
* Navigated to <i>"Settings"</i> and to the <i>"Github Pages"</i> Section.
* From the <i>"Source"</i> section, clicked on the dropdown and selected "Master Branch" from the associated List.
* Once <i>"Master Branch"</i> was selected, the page auto-refreshed, with a ribbon display detailing <i>"Github Pages source saved"</i> indicating the success of the deployment.
* The link to the website was found under the <i>"Github Pages"</i> section, with a ribbon notification stating:<br> __"Your site is published at <a href="https://auxfuse.github.io/Milestone1/">https://auxfuse.github.io/Milestone1/</a>"__


### Testing.

<i>Talk about testing of each facet of each website and on what devices....talk about Chrome Dev Tools....
Talk about hyperlinks testing & modal/CTAs etc. Talk about using Slack and other CI students to test the overall product.
Talk about overriding user agent stylings inherited on some elements like, UL & strange padding, found during testing. </i>


### Work based on other code.

<i>Consider using modal from Whiskey drop page and fragment it to suit our requirements and detail here.....</i>


### What changed after UXD (user design experience) phase.
   Originally planned to have the timetable viewable as one of the webpages....however, after some consideration
   decided to have it as a clickable hyperlink to open in a new window to be viewed, saved or downloaded.
